I have worked on developing a file management web application for a company. Leveraging the Vue.js framework for the frontend and Laravel for the backend, files were stored in AWS S3. The app offered a seamless user experience for managing internal company documents, ensuring appropriate file access permissions for different users to maintain data security.
