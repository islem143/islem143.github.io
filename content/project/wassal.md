I have worked on developing a complete dashboard for a company leveraging the Vue.js framework for the frontend and Laravel for the backend, where I've had the opportunity to engage in a wide array of technical tasks, including:

1-Designing and developing intuitive user interfaces to enhance user experience primarily with Vue.js.

2-Optimizing REST API endpoints and MySQL databases for improved performance and reliability.

3-Leveraging geolocation data and Leaflet maps to create engaging and interactive features.

4-Deploying applications to AWS, utilizing services like AWS S3,Cloudfront, Ec2, VPC, Rds, AWS lamda..., and implementing cost-effective strategies to minimize hosting expenses. 

5-Implementing thorough unit and feature testing methodologies to maintain code quality and reliability.

6-Utilizing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with GitHub Actions for streamlined development workflows.

7-Collaborating cross-functionally to build new API endpoints with Laravel, catering to the needs of both web and mobile applications.
